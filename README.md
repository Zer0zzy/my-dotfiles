"# my-dotfiles" 

This is a work in progress. Currently I have completed only some of the settings.

- [x] Vivaldi - Use profile sync instead
- [ ] PowerToys - Set only the settings files and pull external for PowerToys run extension
- [v] Komorebi
- [v] VSCode
- [ ] Powershell profile - update icon folder
- [v] git
- [v] Windows Terminal
- [ ] install/setup scripts
- [ ] oh-my-posh:WIP
- [ ] Assets
- [ ] Encrypt my secrets
- [ ] Something else I'm probably forgetting

Still need to worry about fonts and other such items.
